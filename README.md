# My Reddit Clone

Welcome to my Reddit Clone. This is my 4th milestone project for the code institute course. The purpose of this project is to create a full stack web app, making use of a Full Stack Framework, and connecting it to a database to demonstrate CRUD functionality.

My Reddit clone will give the user the ability to create posts and share their ideas and content with each other. Posts can be upvoted and are shown in chronological order.

The project is hosted as a heroku app here: [My Reddit Clone](https://)
